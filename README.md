## Command:
python modi-index-pdb-file.py

# more importantly, when running metadynamics:

if the serial number of an atom is greater than 99999, it is written in hybrid-36 notation (see pdbreader).
The main use of pdbrenumber is thus that of producing files where atoms are numbered using hybrid-36 convention.
plumed pdbrenumber --ipdb input.pdb --opdb output.pdb
